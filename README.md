# CreditCardSpendingAnalysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on credit card spending habits using Python, featuring various visualizations including bar plots, pie charts, line plots, and word clouds to uncover spending patterns and trends.

**Introduction**
The goal of this project is to gain insights into customer credit card spending behavior using EDA. We use Python and visualization libraries to explore relationships between factors like gender, card type, spending amount, expenditure type, and more. The analysis helps understand key trends and differences in spending habits.

**Dataset Overview**
The dataset includes records of transactions from multiple customers. Key columns include:

Date: The date of each transaction

Amount: The amount spent in the transaction

Exp Type: The type of expenditure (e.g., travel, dining)

Gender: Gender of the cardholder

Card Type: The type of credit card used (Silver, Platinum, etc.)

City: The city where the transaction took place

**Features**
The analysis is divided into several key areas:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Conversion of date columns

Extraction of month, day, and weekday

Removal of duplicates and handling of missing values

**Visualizations:**

Correlation heatmap to identify relationships between numerical variables

Pie charts to show the distribution of card types and gender

Count plots to show the frequency of transactions by month, day, and expenditure type

Bar plots to analyze total spending based on various factors like gender, card type, and city

WordCloud to visualize the most frequent cities in transactions

**Insights:**

Gender-wise and day-wise spending trends

Weekday vs weekend spending analysis

Top cities by spending amounts

**Technologies Used:**

Python: Core programming language

Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing

NumPy: For numerical operations

Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization

WordCloud: For generating word clouds of transaction cities
